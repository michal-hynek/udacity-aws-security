What findings were detected related to the brute force attack?

GuardDuty didn't find any attacks even after running Hydra for more then an hour (see screenshots).  I assume it was supposed to report UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce based on the documentation - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty-ug.pdf

Research the AWS GuardDuty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information?

AWS GuardDuty monitors VPC Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail management event logs, CloudTrail S3 data event logs, and DNS logs.  It used VPC Flow Logs to detect the brute force attack on port 22 since these are the logs that record network requests.
